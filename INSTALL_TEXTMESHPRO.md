# Installing TextMeshPro

If you don't see "TextMeshPro" in the Window menu, you need to install it first.

## Method 1: Install via Package Manager (Recommended)

1. In Unity, go to: **Window > Package Manager**
2. In the Package Manager window, click the **"+"** button (top-left)
3. Select **"Add package by name..."**
4. Type: `com.unity.textmeshpro`
5. Click **"Add"**
6. Wait for it to install
7. **Then** go to: **Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources**

## Method 2: Install via Unity Hub (If Available)

1. Some Unity versions include TextMeshPro by default
2. Check if it's already in your project: Look for `Assets/TextMesh Pro/` folder
3. If the folder exists but resources aren't imported, you may need to import manually

## Method 3: Manual Import

If the above doesn't work:

1. Go to: **Window > Package Manager**
2. Make sure "In Project" is selected (top-left dropdown)
3. Look for "TextMeshPro" in the list
4. If it's there, click on it
5. Look for an "Import" button or "Import TMP Essentials" button
6. Click it to import the resources

## Verify Installation

After installing:
1. Check if `Assets/TextMesh Pro/` folder exists
2. Go to: **Window > TextMeshPro** (should now appear)
3. Select **"Import TMP Essential Resources"**

## If Still Not Working

If TextMeshPro still doesn't appear:
1. Your Unity version might be very old
2. Try updating Unity to 2021.3 LTS or newer
3. TextMeshPro is included in Unity 2018.2+ but may need to be added via Package Manager in older versions
