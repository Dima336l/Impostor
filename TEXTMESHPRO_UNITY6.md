# TextMeshPro for Unity 6

You're using Unity 6 (6000.3.3f1). TextMeshPro should be available. Try these steps:

## Method 1: Check Package Manager Registry

1. Go to: **Window > Package Manager**
2. In the top-left dropdown, make sure **"Unity Registry"** is selected (not "In Project")
3. In the search box, type: **"TextMeshPro"**
4. Look for **"Text Mesh Pro"** in the results
5. Click on it
6. Click **"Install"** button (if not already installed)
7. After installation, click **"Import TMP Essentials"** button

## Method 2: Check if Already Installed

1. In Project window, look for: **`Assets/TextMesh Pro/`** folder
2. If it exists, TextMeshPro is installed
3. Go to: **Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources**
4. If that menu doesn't exist, try Method 3

## Method 3: Manual Import

1. In Package Manager, select **"In Project"** (top-left dropdown)
2. Look for **"Text Mesh Pro"** or **"com.unity.textmeshpro"**
3. If you see it, click on it
4. Look for **"Import TMP Essentials"** or **"Import"** button
5. Click it

## Method 4: Add via manifest.json

If nothing else works, we can add it directly to the package manifest.

## Quick Check

First, please check:
1. **Package Manager > Unity Registry** - Search for "TextMeshPro"
2. **Project window** - Look for `Assets/TextMesh Pro/` folder
3. **Package Manager > In Project** - Look for TextMeshPro in the list
