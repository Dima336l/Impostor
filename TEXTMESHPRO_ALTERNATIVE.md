# TextMeshPro Installation - Alternative Methods

If Package Manager doesn't find TextMeshPro, try these methods:

## Method 1: Check if Already Installed

1. In Unity Project window, look for: **`Assets/TextMesh Pro/`** folder
2. If the folder exists:
   - TextMeshPro is already installed!
   - You just need to import resources:
   - Go to: **Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources**
   - If that menu doesn't exist, see Method 2

## Method 2: Check Package Manager List

1. Go to: **Window > Package Manager**
2. In the top-left dropdown, select **"In Project"** (not "Unity Registry")
3. Look for **"TextMeshPro"** in the list
4. If you see it:
   - Click on it
   - Look for **"Import TMP Essentials"** button
   - Click it

## Method 3: Manual Import from Unity Installation

If TextMeshPro isn't in your project:

1. Check your Unity version: **Help > About Unity**
2. Unity 2018.2+ includes TextMeshPro
3. Try: **Assets > Import Package > TextMeshPro** (if available)
4. Or: Look in Unity installation folder for TextMeshPro package

## Method 4: Download from Asset Store

1. Go to Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/
2. Search for "TextMeshPro"
3. Download the free package
4. Import it into your project

## Method 5: Check Unity Version

If you're using Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer:
- TextMeshPro should be available
- Try: **Window > Package Manager > Unity Registry** (top-left dropdown)
- Search for "TextMeshPro"
- Click "Install"

## Quick Check

First, let's verify what you have:
1. Check Project window for `Assets/TextMesh Pro/` folder
2. Check Package Manager for TextMeshPro in the list
3. Tell me what Unity version you're using (Help > About Unity)

This will help determine the best installation method.
